# Welcome to my Portfolio Website Repo!

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, which was built entirely from scratch using React. Unlike simple website builders, I developed this website myself, which required some more work and time, but also provided a lot of flexibility and control over the design and functionality of the website.

The website is a showcase of my projects, skills, and experience as a developer. I have also included information about my interests and background to give potential employers or colleagues an insight into my personality and work environment.

I hope you find my portfolio website useful and can be inspired by the code. If you have any questions or suggestions, or are interested in collaborating, please do not hesitate to contact me. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to expand my skills as a web developer.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio website repository!
